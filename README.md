# Arcade Game Project

This arcade game project replicates the classic game of Frogger. Select the character of your choice to start the game. Traverse the hazards of a three lane road whilst attempting to avoid the enemy lady bugs that zoom from left to right
down the three lane road.

You have 60 seconds to cross the road as many times as they can. In order ro score points, you must pick up the orange 
gem stones that appear randomly across the road way, and carry the stones to the river at the far side of the road. You will 
receive 1 point for each gem stone successfully collected and transported.

If you collide with a lady bug, you will lose a life. When all three lives are lost the game will be over and the final score will be displayed.

To restart the game, click on the character of your choice.
